"""Shape graph construction + tactical position inference (TF-39).

Implements the iterative edge-removal algorithm (Algorithm 1) and face-center
position decomposition (Chapter 4, §4.1-4.3) from Sotudeh (2026).

The shape graph is a sparse, stable subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation.
Unstable edges (low angular stability) are iteratively removed and their
incident faces merged, producing a clean proximity graph that filters the
"flicker" noise inherent in raw Delaunay triangulations of player positions.

Position inference decomposes player coordinates into a 5x5 grid of tactical
roles (5 vertical levels: B/DM/M/AM/F, 5 horizontal levels: L/LC/C/RC/R)
using recursive face-center decomposition along each axis.

    """Infer tactical positions from player positions via face-center decomposition.

    Vertical decomposition uses the x-coordinate (attacking axis) with face
    centroids as split boundaries. Horizontal decomposition uses the y-coordinate
    (lateral axis) similarly. This follows thesis Chapter 4, §4.1-4.3.

    If ``attacking_direction < 0``, the x-axis is flipped before level assignment,
    so that "B" (back) always refers to the defensive end.

    The lateral label is PITCH-ABSOLUTE: ``y`` is deliberately NOT mirrored for a
    reversed attacking direction (only ``x`` is negated, which reverses level
    ORDERING). Settled by default (ADR-045 D5): this function has no in-library
    consumer, so no behaviour validates either convention. A future consumer that
    needs TEAM-RELATIVE lateral labels should negate ``y`` AND ``face_centers_y``
    together (``-y``, a sort-direction negation, not ``68 - y``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape_graph : ShapeGraph
        Computed shape graph (its faces provide decomposition boundaries).
    positions : np.ndarray
        (n, 2) array of player positions.
    attacking_direction : float
        +1.0 if attacking toward higher x, -1.0 if lower.

    Returns
    -------
    list[PositionLabel]
        One per player. Empty if shape graph has no edges.
